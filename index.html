        <h2>Understanding the Three Main Types of Credit</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <p>The three main types of credit are <strong>instalment</strong>, <strong>revolving</strong>, and <strong>open</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Instalment Credit</h3>
        <p>Instalment credit is a loan with a fixed amount of money, fixed payments, and an established repayment schedule.</p>
        
        <h3>Revolving Credit</h3>
        <p>Revolving credit allows you to continuously borrow money against a line of credit and pay it back with monthly payments.</p>
        
        <h3>Open Credit</h3>
        <p>Open credit also allows you to continuously borrow money, but there are no interest rates, and you're required to pay your balance in full each month to avoid penalties.</p>

        <h3>Why Understanding Credit Matters</h3>
        <p>It's important to understand the different types of credit so you can confidently choose which one is best for you and make informed borrowing decisions. Appropriately using various types of credit contributes to your credit diversity (also known as credit mix), which can help improve your credit score.</p>
